# Traffic Management
> Improving understanding of traffic to enhance performance

This project aims to explore the impact of the road network, control signal programming and the behaviour of vehicles on traffic flow.  The creation and customisation of realistic simulations provides accurate information regarding traffic flow perforamce parameters. (nables the impact on traffic flow to be measured.) This improves decision making for permit more efficient traffic flow.

## Getting started

Download the code for the simualtion of your choice. 
Open in a code editor which supports Python.
Install necessary python packages as listed at the top of the python script.
Execute the code and the simulations will begin and a graphic window will pop up displaying the vehicles in the road network.

## Developing

## Features

The functionality of the program is to simulate different traffic scenarios and calculate the value of performance parameters to assess the system. The programs enable a high level of customisation. The layout of the road network can be altered to mimic any desired layout. The traffic which passes through the road network can be can fully defined prior to the simualtion as each route of each vehicle can be specified. The traffic light signal control system, which permits vehicles to progress through the road network, can be fully customised.

## Configuration
The user can enter simple argument changes to alter the input to the simualtion and experiment to find the affect on the performance of the system. These arguments include: the total number of cars which will participate in the simualtion (num_cars); the number of cars that will start in the system (initial_num_cars_in_system); the number of cars that will enter the system during the course of the simulation (num_cars_to_enter_system); the frequency at which cars will enter the system (car_enter_time_interval) and the length of the time the simulation will run for (time_limit).
