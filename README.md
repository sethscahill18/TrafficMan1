# Traffic Management
> Improving understanding of traffic to enhance performance OR Understanding impacts of traffic flow to imporve performance

This project aims to explore the impact of the road network, control signal programming and the behaviour of vehicles on traffic flow.  The creation and customisation of realistic simulations provides accurate information regarding traffic flow perforamce parameters. This information can be used to improve decision making with regard to increasing traffic flow efficiency.

## Getting started

Download the code for the simualtion of your choice. 
Open in a code editor which supports Python.
Install necessary python packages as listed at the top of the python script.
Execute the code to initiate the simulations and a graphic window will pop up displaying the vehicles in the road network.

## Developing

## Features

The functionality of the program is to simulate different traffic scenarios and calculate the value of performance parameters to assess the system. The programs enable a high level of customisation. The layout of the road network can be altered to mimic any desired layout. The traffic which passes through the road network can be can fully defined prior to the simualtion as the route taken by each vehicle can be specified. The traffic light signal control system, which permits vehicles to progress through the road network, can be fully customised.

## Configuration
The user can enter simple argument changes to alter the input to the simulation and thus permit experimentation to find the affect on the performance of the system. These arguments include: the total number of cars which will participate in the simulation (num_cars); the number of cars that will start in the system (num_initial_internal_cars); the time interval between a set of new cars entering the system (car_entry_interval_timer_limit); the number of cars in each set which enter the simulation (new_cars_per_interval) and the length of the time the simulation will run (time_limit). Changing the value of these arguments 

# Links

In the repository of this project (link to repository) there are three scripts of code which simulate different traffic scenarios. The first of which, traffic_code_1.py, simulates a complex road network which consists of atypical junctions and layouts inspired from a street map of New York. This script demonstrates the high level of customisability of the road network afforded to the user by the program. This enables the user to assess the impact on traffic flow of different road networks. (basically allowing the user to design and simulate any road layout that they wish.)

The following two scripts, traffic_code_2.py and traffic_code_3.py, share the same road network such that the two can be compared to assess the impact of different sign control systems. The road network used in both simualtions is a simple grid system which consists of a predetermined number of equally spaced junctions. The traffic_code_2 script implements a set timer cyclical control system. This means that each traffic signal at a junction will be green for the same amount of time, hence being referred to as a "set timer". Furthermore, the order of which the traffic signals at a junction turn green follows a preset sequence and as time passes the traffic signals will continuously loop through this sequence, this is described as the "cyclical" nature of the control system. The second script, traffic_code_3, employs at adaptive control system which varies the length of time a traffic signal is green and once the green period for a traffic signal has ended any traffic signal at the junction could be selected to turn green next, hence the control system does not follow a predefined sequence. This program is thus adaptable and not predefined. (tempted not to mention that it is repsonsive to the current traffic situation.) Once both sample codes are completed the traffic flow performance parameters are calculated and displayed. This allows for a comparison to be made between the different signal control systems.
